# PHP-Advanced-OOP-project-MySQL
This is the second half of the advanced PHP tutorials. This is focused on OOP interacting with a MySQL Database. The project idea is creating a photo gallery website where I can upload photos to a web server which outputs them. Again I am learning so much since I am following a practical application of the PHP and MySQL code.
