1. First thing is to set up the log directory. I do this by changing the group to www-data which apache2 web server belongs to. Then I have changed the permission for both the user and the group to allow reading and writing. This was done outside of php with the terminal itself.

I need to append the entries to the end of the file can do this with a+ I think.
